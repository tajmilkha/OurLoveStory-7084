While everyone else was chaotic, loud, always trying to prove something, she was calm. Quiet. She moved through the server with this graceful energy that made me stop and actually look.",
      "And then I noticed the crown. This little 8-bit crown sitting on her avatar. Something about it just... caught me. It was simple, but elegant. Like her whole aesthetic. This beautiful outfit, put together with actual thought and care. She stood out without even trying. For four weeks, I didn't say a word to her. I just watched. Noticed her. Every time she was in a server, I'd see her. I'd notice the way she played, the way she carried herself. She never got involved in the drama. She was just there, doing her own thing, being peaceful. And I was drawn to that peace like I'd been wandering in chaos my whole life.",

I couldn't handle another betrayal.",

Weeks later, we ran into each other randomly. I apologized. Tried to explain. And she said something that changed everything: she didn't know about the drama. She had no idea about the wars, my reputation, any of it. She was just... her. Just PRiViLEDGE. Just the girl with the crown who liked being peaceful.",
      "We started over. Slowly. Carefully. Just greetings at first. Then playful interactions. Then conversations that got longer. Nights that got later. Jokes that became inside references. She didn't know I was the strongest player in the game. She didn't know my history. And honestly? That's what made it special. She liked me for me, not for who I was in the fighting community, not for what I could do. Just me. She filled a space I didn't even know was empty.",
