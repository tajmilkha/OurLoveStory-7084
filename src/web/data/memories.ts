While everyone else was chaotic, loud, always trying to prove something, she was calm. Quiet. She moved through the server with this graceful energy that made me stop and actually look.",

This beautiful outfit, put together with actual thought and care. She stood out without even trying. For four weeks, I didn't say a word to her. I just watched. Noticed her. Every time she was in a server, I'd see her. I'd notice the way she played, the way she carried herself. She never got involved in the drama. She was just there, doing her own thing, being peaceful.
