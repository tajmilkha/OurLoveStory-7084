[{"description":"Create a romantic home page with a warm, cozy aesthetic. Include a hero section with a sweet intro about a couple's love story. Design should feel like a digital scrapbook - soft colors (pastels or warm tones), smooth animations, and subtle heart motifs integrated tastefully throughout (floating hearts, heart-shaped dividers, or subtle patterns). The intro should be warm and genuine, blending romance with shared gaming memories. Add a beautiful call-to-action inviting visitors to explore their story. Make it mobile-friendly with gentle fade-in animations. The overall vibe should be nostalgic, intimate, and aesthetic - like opening a cherished love letter.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1}]
