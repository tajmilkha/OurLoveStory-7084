[{"description":"Create a romantic home page with a warm, cozy aesthetic. Include a hero section with a sweet intro about a couple's love story. Design should feel like a digital scrapbook - soft colors (pastels or warm tones), smooth animations, and subtle heart motifs integrated tastefully throughout (floating hearts, heart-shaped dividers, or subtle patterns). The intro should be warm and genuine, blending romance with shared gaming memories. Add a beautiful call-to-action inviting visitors to explore their story. Make it mobile-friendly with gentle fade-in animations. The overall vibe should be nostalgic, intimate, and aesthetic - like opening a cherished love letter.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1},{"description":"Add an 'Our Story' timeline section below the hero. Create a vertical timeline with milestones showing how the couple met and key moments in their relationship. Include dates/timeframes and descriptions for events like 'First Match', 'First Voice Call', 'Became Official', 'First IRL Meeting', 'Our Adventures'. Design should have a romantic aesthetic with connecting lines, subtle heart markers, and smooth scroll animations. Use the same warm color palette. Make it feel like flipping through a scrapbook of memories.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":2},{"description":"Add a photo gallery section for Roblox screenshots and memories. Create a beautiful grid or masonry-style gallery with placeholder images (use image generation or placeholder service). Each image should have hover effects and space for captions. Include a romantic heading like 'Our Gaming Adventures' or 'Pixelated Memories'. Design should feel cohesive with the rest of the page - warm tones, smooth animations, heart motifs. Gallery should be responsive and work beautifully on mobile.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":3},{"description":"Replace the placeholder gallery images with the user's actual Roblox screenshots. Copy these 6 images to the public folder: /home/user/Attachments/31fc7f40-697c-47e2-98ff-bdc9525d9403.jpeg, /home/user/Attachments/90f8d236-efb5-4410-9698-60e723f79dd3.jpeg, /home/user/Attachments/8eb8a845-2fc5-4bfa-a083-ce813a7c5db9.jpeg, /home/user/Attachments/60deb0a5-7dc5-4016-b45a-942375cfd7bc.jpeg, /home/user/Attachments/f7dda9f1-7e82-41da-9599-bdbeef2211aa.jpeg, /home/user/Attachments/b8c2a3fb-6446-480a-ad2d-9a77350ee643.jpeg. Update the gallery section to display these real Roblox screenshots instead of placeholders. The captions can be romantic and playful about their gaming memories together.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":4}]
