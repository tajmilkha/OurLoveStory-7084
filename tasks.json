[{"description":"Create a romantic home page with a warm, cozy aesthetic. Include a hero section with a sweet intro about a couple's love story. Design should feel like a digital scrapbook - soft colors (pastels or warm tones), smooth animations, and subtle heart motifs integrated tastefully throughout (floating hearts, heart-shaped dividers, or subtle patterns). The intro should be warm and genuine, blending romance with shared gaming memories. Add a beautiful call-to-action inviting visitors to explore their story. Make it mobile-friendly with gentle fade-in animations. The overall vibe should be nostalgic, intimate, and aesthetic - like opening a cherished love letter.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1},{"description":"Add an 'Our Story' timeline section below the hero. Create a vertical timeline with milestones showing how the couple met and key moments in their relationship. Include dates/timeframes and descriptions for events like 'First Match', 'First Voice Call', 'Became Official', 'First IRL Meeting', 'Our Adventures'.

Create a beautiful grid or masonry-style gallery with placeholder images (use image generation or placeholder service). Each image should have hover effects and space for captions.

Gallery should be responsive and work beautifully on mobile.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":3},{"description":"Replace the placeholder gallery images with the user's actual Roblox screenshots.
